# LeetCode Problems

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems that I am solving as part of my practice.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress in solving algorithm and data structure problems on LeetCode. Each problem will be documented with the solution, and the repository will be organized by the difficulty level or type of problem (e.g., Array, Dynamic Programming, etc.).

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Easy**: Solutions to easy-level problems.
- **Medium**: Solutions to medium-level problems.
- **Hard**: Solutions to hard-level problems.
- **Notes**: Additional notes and resources related to problem-solving approaches and techniques.

Feel free to explore and follow along as I continue to work through various challenges!
