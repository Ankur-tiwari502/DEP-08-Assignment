# Frontend Practice - EPAM System

This repository will contain all of my frontend practice during my training period at EPAM System.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the work I am doing as part of my frontend development practice from **FrontendLab**. All exercises, assignments, and projects completed during my training will be uploaded here.

## Important Note

Please note that the **first day's frontend practice** was mistakenly uploaded to a different repository. The correct repository for the first day's practice can be found at: 

[Frontend Practice - Day 1](https://github.com/Ankur-tiwari502/FronteEnd-Practice)

Moving forward, all further frontend practice will be tracked and uploaded to this repository.

## Folder Structure

The repository will contain the following folders:

- **Exercises**: Small challenges and practice exercises.
- **Projects**: Larger, more complex frontend projects.
- **Resources**: Any external resources or notes used during the practice.

Thank you for following along, and stay tuned for more updates!
