# Web Storage and Cookies Implementation

Welcome to the repository! In this project, you will find implementations and examples related to **localStorage**, **sessionStorage**, **cookies**, and **IndexedDB**. The code for cookies and IndexedDB has already been committed, and further resources will be shared shortly.

## Resources

1. **localStorage**:
   You can study localStorage from the following slide deck:
   - [HTML5 localStorage - SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/html5-local-storage/34552478)

2. **sessionStorage**:
   Learn more about sessionStorage here:
   - [JavaScript sessionStorage - JavaScriptTutorial.net](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-sessionstorage/)

## Code Implementation

The code for **cookies** and **IndexedDB** is already committed in this repository. Feel free to explore and use them for your understanding.

### Cookies
The code for handling cookies is included in this repo. A PowerPoint presentation explaining cookies in detail will be shared by me shortly. Stay tuned!

### IndexedDB
You can also find examples of **IndexedDB** usage in the repository. IndexedDB allows you to store large amounts of data in the browser, with support for structured objects.

## Next Steps

- Study the provided resources for **localStorage** and **sessionStorage**.
- Explore the code for **cookies** and **IndexedDB** already committed in the repo.
- Wait for the PowerPoint presentation on cookies, which will be shared soon.
